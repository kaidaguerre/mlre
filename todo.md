# TODO
 
- [ ] Threshold recording (not one=-shot)
- [ ] Splice Chaining
- [ ] Deletion confirmation
- [ ] Foor controller MIDI
- [ ] Look at timing precision for splice select sync - can we trigger an event on looping? 
- [ ] Add option for auto-length set all active, (unrecorded?) splices to the same length (for first channel only) - to emulate standard looper behaviour
